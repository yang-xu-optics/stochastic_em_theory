# Wiki Log

Append-only chronological record. New entries should use:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] action | Short Title
```

## [2026-06-06] setup | Initialize Codex LLM Wiki Workspace

- Created the Codex schema in `AGENTS.md`.
- Initialized wiki index, log, overview, research agenda, theory, model, and
  simulation planning pages.
- Added raw, code, results, and paper workspace guides.
- Noted that no `CLAUDE.md` file existed to rename; `AGENTS.md` is now the
  Codex counterpart and canonical schema.

## [2026-06-06] ingest | Newly Added Squeezed-Vacuum HHG And THz Papers

- Created 13 unique source-summary pages under `wiki/sources/`.
- Detected that the two Gorlach 2023 raw PDFs extract to identical text and
  represented them with one duplicate-aware source summary.
- Updated the wiki index, overview, research agenda, theory proof plan, HHG
  gas model, THz optical rectification model, THz plasma model, simulation
  roadmap, and manuscript outline.
- Key ingest decisions: treat Raymer/Landes as the stochastic/quantum
  correspondence spine; treat Gorlach/Rasputnyi/Heimerl as support for
  phase-space-weighted coherent-response HHG; treat Schuh/Sun/Wang as the
  plasma THz basis; keep pure squeezed-vacuum optical rectification marked as
  a source gap until derived or sourced.

## [2026-06-06] ingest | Ravi 2014 Optical Rectification Thesis

- Ingested `raw/sources/900736523-MIT.pdf` as
  [[sources/ravi-2014-thz-generation-optical-rectification]].
- Noted that the title page identifies the file as an MIT Master of Science
  thesis, not a doctoral thesis.
- Updated the optical-rectification model, simulation roadmap, overview,
  research agenda, wiki index, and manuscript outline.
- Key decision: use Ravi 2014 as the classical tilted-pulse-front OR propagation
  baseline, while keeping squeezed-vacuum-driven OR as an open derivation
  problem involving ensemble averaging, operator ordering, and possible vacuum
  subtraction.

## [2026-06-06] ingest | Non-Gaussian Mesoscopic Nonlinear Optics Papers

- Ingested three newly added papers by Yanagimoto et al. 2022, Jankowski et al.
  2024, and Yanagimoto et al. 2024.
- Created [[sources/yanagimoto-2022-nongaussian-pulsed-squeezing]],
  [[sources/jankowski-2024-ultrafast-chi2-nonlinear-photonics]], and
  [[sources/yanagimoto-2024-mesoscopic-ultrafast-nonlinear-optics]].
- Added [[theory/non-gaussian-output-novelty]] to distinguish classical
  non-Gaussian shot distributions from genuine quantum non-Gaussian emitted or
  conditional states.
- Updated HHG, THz OR, THz plasma, simulation roadmap, research agenda, index,
  overview, and paper outline with non-Gaussian observables and cautions.

## [2026-06-06] ingest | Literature Search Batch For Squeezed HHG And THz Project

- Used the project-local paper-lookup, literature-review, and paperzilla skill
  instructions. Paperzilla's `pz` CLI and `parallel-cli` were not installed, so
  Paperzilla/feed recommendations were unavailable and the literature-review
  search workflow was executed manually through APIs.
- Queried OpenAlex, Crossref, and arXiv across focused clusters for BSV/quantum
  light HHG, strong-field ionization/tunneling, squeezed-vacuum propagation,
  stochastic SPDC/PDC, pump depletion, and non-Gaussian ultrafast nonlinear
  optics. Semantic Scholar was attempted but returned HTTP 429 without an API
  key.
- Downloaded 35 new non-duplicate PDFs into `raw/sources/`; extracted text for
  all 35 into `results/literature-search-2026-06-06/extracted_text/`; created
  35 first-pass source-summary pages under `wiki/sources/`.
- Recorded search/download manifests under
  `results/literature-search-2026-06-06/`.
- Two relevant APS-only papers were found but not downloaded because the
  command-line PDF links were Cloudflare-blocked:
  "High harmonic generation from an atom in a squeezed-vacuum environment" and
  "Effect of photon quantum statistics on electrons in above-threshold
  ionization".
- Updated the wiki index, overview, stochastic/quantum correspondence page,
  `g^(2)` proof plan, HHG model, THz OR model, non-Gaussian novelty map,
  simulation roadmap, research agenda, and manuscript outline.
